# lapse-hs (WIP)
This is Lapse (my Lisp dialect) interpreter.

Examples: [here](https://github.com/ProggerX/lapse-hs/blob/master/example/)

## How to use this/try this
- Go to [this page](https://github.com/ProggerX/lapse-hs/actions)
- Click on latest successful action run (or run from specific tag)
- Find an "Artifacts" section and download version for your OS. (If you can't see download button, log in to your github account)
- Unzip this artifact and you will get an executable of Lapse interpreter
- To run some code, write this code in ".lp" file (in fact, extension does not matter) and run `<path-to-lapse-interpreter> <path-to-file>` command in command line
- (You can find example files [here](https://github.com/ProggerX/lapse-hs/blob/master/example/))
- Also, Lapse provides a clean REPL by `<path-to-lapse-interpreter>` command
